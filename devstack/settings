# Devstack settings

# Each service you enable has the following meaning:
# odl-neutron - Add this config flag if Opendaylight controller and OpenStack
#               Controller are on different nodes.
# odl-server  - Add this config flag if Opendaylight controller and OpenStack
#               Controller are on the same node.
# odl-compute - Add this config flag for OpenStack Compute.
#
# NOTE: odl-server includes odl-neutron.
#
# An example of enabling all-in-one ODL is below.
#enable_service odl-compute odl-server

# This can be overridden in the localrc file
ODL_MODE=${ODL_MODE:-allinone}

# ODL_MODE is used to configure how devstack works with OpenDaylight. You
# can configure this three ways:
#
# ODL_MODE=allinone
# Use this mode if you want to run ODL in this devstack instance. Useful
# for a single node deployment or on the control node of a multi-node
# devstack environment.
#
# ODL_MODE=compute
# Use this for the compute nodes of a multi-node devstack install.
#
# ODL_MODE=externalodl
# This installs the neutron code for ODL, but does not attempt to
# manage ODL in devstack. This is used for development environments
# similar to the allinone case except where you are using bleeding edge ODL
# which is not yet released, and thus don't want it managed by
# devstack.
#
# ODL_MODE=manual
# You're on your own here, and are enabling services outside the scope of
# the ODL_MODE variable.
