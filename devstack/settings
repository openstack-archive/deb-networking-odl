# Devstack settings

# Each service you enable has the following meaning:
# odl-neutron - Add this config flag if Opendaylight controller and OpenStack
#               Controller are on different nodes.
# odl-server  - Add this config flag if Opendaylight controller and OpenStack
#               Controller are on the same node.
# odl-compute - Add this config flag for OpenStack Compute.
#
# NOTE: odl-server includes odl-neutron.
#
# An example of enabling all-in-one ODL is below.
#enable_service odl-compute odl-server

# This can be overridden in the localrc file
ODL_MODE=${ODL_MODE:-allinone}

# What release to use. Choices are:
#
#   beryllium-snapshot-0.4.0 (master)
#   lithium-snapshot-0.3.1 (stable)
#   lithium-snapshot-0.3.0
#   helium-snapshot
#   helium
ODL_RELEASE=${ODL_RELEASE:-lithium-snapshot-0.3.1}

# ODL_MODE is used to configure how devstack works with OpenDaylight. You
# can configure this three ways:
#
# ODL_MODE=allinone
# Use this mode if you want to run ODL in this devstack instance. Useful
# for a single node deployment or on the control node of a multi-node
# devstack environment.
#
# ODL_MODE=compute
# Use this for the compute nodes of a multi-node devstack install.
#
# ODL_MODE=externalodl
# This installs the neutron code for ODL, but does not attempt to
# manage ODL in devstack. This is used for development environments
# similar to the allinone case except where you are using bleeding edge ODL
# which is not yet released, and thus don't want it managed by
# devstack.
#
# ODL_MODE=manual
# You're on your own here, and are enabling services outside the scope of
# the ODL_MODE variable.

# Set a few things up for Neutron here

# We are explicitly enabling the opendaylight ML2 MechanismDriver here.
# Note we are also enabling the logger driver, which is helpful for
# debugging things on the Neutron side.
Q_ML2_PLUGIN_MECHANISM_DRIVERS=opendaylight,logger

# We have to disable the neutron L2 agent. OpenDaylight does not use the
# L2 agent, it instead uses a combination of OpenFlow and OVSDB commands
# to program OVS on each compute and network node host.
